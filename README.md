This is a work in progress updated version of my personal website. The previous version was a couple years out of date and I've since become far more familiar with web development and design. The previous version is still visible in the branch old-main.

To-Do List:
 - Upload Figma design docs to Github
 - Proper file structure
 - Develop personal icon
 - Finalize personal logo animation
 - Add personal links (Github, Linkedin, etc.)
 - Finalize general website content
