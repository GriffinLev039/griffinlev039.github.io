A live version of this page should be viewable at https://jiggly.cc soon!

Soon this will be merged into the griffinlev.dev Github pages repo. 
This is a work in progress updated version of my personal website. The current version is a couple years out of date and I've since become far more familiar with web development and design.

To-Do List:
 - Upload Figma design docs to Github
 - Proper file structure
 - Implement React to design lower half of pages
 - Make icon functional
 - Other portions of website - "About Me", "My Projects (Uses a REST api to list projects), viewable on other Github repo on my profile"
